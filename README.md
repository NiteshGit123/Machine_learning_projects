Hi folks..
This is my machine learning project done during machine learning course.
Aim of this project was to model the waste management cost as the function of other factors such people in a locality,insdustry in the locality etc.
The dataset for the project was obtained from kaggle.


1. Various preprocessing techniques were used such as missing value imputation,log transformations etc.
2. all the imputation techniques after proper visualization of training data.
3. It was a regression problem, so we used linear regression model.
4. For reducing complexity we used Lasso and Ridge regression.
5. Weights for different features were analyzed for each technique:Lasso,Ridge,Linear etc
6. MSE and R2 score was used as the metric for evaluation.
